TODO list for 2.0
----------------

This is a list of pending features / bug fixes / whatever before
2.0 can be released. It is not exhaustive, just a place to keep
a record of pending work.


* Sniffers:

sniffer-bpf.c
sniffer-como.c
sniffer-flowtools.c
sniffer-netflow.c
sniffer-ondemand.c
sniffer-radio.c
sniffer-sflow.c
sniffer-sk98.c
sniffer-wpcap.c


* Modules:

autofocus
supersources
multiple pattern search


* Configuration

 - Do more error checking.
 - Fix example.conf
 - argsfile keyword
 - get modules from cmdline

* Features

 - Modules:
    . replay()
    . in and outdescs
    . documentation
    . optional: add some type checking for callbacks
    . port all modules

 - Load Shedding
        . port basic functionality from CoMo 0.5.
        . take into account that CoMo may not always run at the highest
          priority.
        . manage context switches and CPU cycles of the export process.
        . revise buffer discovery algorithm.


* Bugs

 - deserialize_string should work when the target structure field
   is a character array. Right now only works when target is a char pointer.

 - Capture and Export may enter an IPC deadlock

* Code cleanups

 - Either port or remove old/unused code.
    base/old
    modules/old
    old_code/
    lib/unused_code

 - Examine the utility of the following includes, which right now CoMo2.0 can compile without

 heap.h (companion of unused heap.c)
 macutils.h (companion of unused macutils.c)
 mempool.h (companion of unused mempool.c)
 pattern_search.h (companion of unused pattern_search.c)
 ptr_array.h (companion of unused ptr_array.c)

 - Remove commented code or old structs in include/*.h
