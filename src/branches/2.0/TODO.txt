TODO list for 2.0
----------------

This is a list of pending features / bug fixes / whatever before
2.0 can be released. It is not exhaustive, just a place to keep
a record of pending work.


* Sniffers:

sniffer-bpf.c
sniffer-como.c
sniffer-flowtools.c
sniffer-netflow.c
sniffer-ondemand.c
sniffer-radio.c
sniffer-sflow.c
sniffer-sk98.c
sniffer-wpcap.c


* Modules:

autofocus
supersources
multiple pattern search


* Parse como.conf

 - Preferably, write a new parser with flex and bison.


* Features

 - replay()

 - Load Shedding
        . port basic functionality from CoMo 0.5.
        . take into account that CoMo may not always run at the highest
          priority.
        . manage context switches and CPU cycles of the export process.
        . revise buffer discovery algorithm.


* Bugs

 - Query dies when /?module=mdl&args... query scheme is used by client.
   A rewrite of the parser with flex and bison would also be nice.

 - deserialize_string should work when the target structure field
   is a character array. Right now only works when target is a char pointer.

 - Capture and Export may enter an IPC deadlock
