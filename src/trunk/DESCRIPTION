CoMo -- Continuous Monitoring

CoMo is a passive network monitoring system. CoMo has been designed to be 
the basic building block for a network monitoring infrastructure that will 
allow researchers and network operators to easily process and share network 
traffic statistics over multiple sites. The architecture of CoMo is designed
to compute and report various performance metrics while sustaining high speed 
traffic collection. There is a strict decoupling between the CoMo core system 
and the measurement modules. The core system moves the data from the network 
to memory and storage and manages the system resources. The measurement 
modules simply pick packets of interest and compute a specific traffic metric. 
CoMo is open in the sense that modules can be implemented independently and 
from different developers and then plugged into the systems dynamically. CoMo 
also provides a query interface to allow users to elicit the system to export 
the results of the measurement performed.
