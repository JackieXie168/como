The CoMo (Continuous Monitoring) project.

We aim to design the fundamental building block of a network monitoring 
infrastructure that allows researchers and network operators to process 
and share network data across multiple sites. 
CoMo supports i) arbitrary traffic queries that run continuously on the 
live data streams, and ii) retrospective queries that analyze past traffic 
data to enable network forensics.

Data streams may have different formats (e.g., packet sequences, flow 
summaries, etc.) and originate from different platforms (e.g, passive 
link monitors, routers, wireless access points, etc.). CoMo can operate 
in the presence of different devices and data sources and provide a 
unified data interface to queries. Multiple CoMo systems will also cooperate 
to rapidly disseminate queries throughout the network of monitors, allowing 
operators to "drill down" to relevant data locations in the network.
