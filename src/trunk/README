CoMo is open source and is released under terms of the BSD License. 
CoMo has been tested under Linux 2.4, 2.6 and FreeBSD 4.x and 5.x.

In order to install CoMo follow these steps:

# tar -xvzf como-0.3.tar.gz
# cd como-0.3
# make

CoMo requires gmake v3.80 or higher to compile correctly. It is possible to 
set a few configuration options to build a customized CoMo binary. The 
options can be found in config_var.default. Rename that file to 
config_var.local to customize your release. 

There are five options supported so far:

* HAVE_FTLIB_AND_ZLIB, needed to compile the flow-tools support. 
  CoMo only supports flow-tools v0.67 or higher.

* USE_DAG, needed to run the packet sniffer with Endace DAG cards. 
  It requires DAG API v2.4 or higher.

* USE_SK98, to support SysKonnect* cards with modified drivers for Linux. 
  This will allow to use the sniffer-sk98 but only runs under Linux. 
  It requires a driver that can be found at:
  http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/nprobe/downloads/sk98lin.tar.bz2 

* USE_SNORT_MODULE and USE_FILTER_PARSER, needed respectively to run the Snort
  module and to use the Flex/Bison parser for CoMo filters.
  Bison v1.875 or higher is required. 

* HAVE_PCRE, needed to use the Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions support
  in the Snort module. It requires that libpcre is installed.
  
* USE_STARGATE, to compile the code for the Crossbow's Stargate platform 
  (see platformx.sourceforge.net). It requires arm-linux-gcc 3.2.2.

Once built the como binary will reside in base/como. An example configuration 
file can be found in base/example.conf. A man page can be found in 
man/como.1 (run "nroff -man como.1" to view it formatted properly).
