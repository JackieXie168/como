Modules need to know if we've dropped packets which were intended for
them.  We assume there are two types of drops: global and local.  A
global drop causes the packet to not be seen by any module, and is
generated by the sniffer, whereas a local drop causes it to be missed
by one specific module, and is generated by capture proper.

We don't make any distinction between the two forms when presenting
them to the modules; they just get a count of how many packets they've
missed.  They are, however, handled differently in CoMo proper.

Global drops are handled by having a global count of how many packets
have been dropped, and then a per-module count of how many global
drops have been reported to that module (this is necessary because the
modules might not be able to receive messages when the drop occurs
because e.g. we've run out of memory, and they might become able to
receive at different times).  Local drops are handled by just having a
per-module counter of unreported local drops.
