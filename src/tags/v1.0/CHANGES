---- CoMo v1.0 (May 14th, 2006) 
--

. New License
 
  This new release carries a new BSD license. For more details look 
  into the LICENSE file. The new license is also available at: 
  http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php

. Implemented sFlow sniffer

  Sniffer to support sFlow format (see RFC 3176). It supports receiving
  directly the raw data from the switches. It introduces a new L2 type 
  (COMOTYPE_SFLOW). 

. Major rewrite of IPC code
 
  Rewritten inter-process communication code. It is now used for all 
  communications between SUPERVISOR, CAPTURE, EXPORT and STORAGE including 
  tables flushed, I/O block writes/reads. 

. Major rewrite of the packet stream meta descriptions
 
  Rewritten the way modules and sniffers describe the packet streams 
  they are capable of generating. The new code allows for simpler 
  specification of the templates as well as easier and more efficient 
  matching of the templates. 

. Memory management for modules

  Modules can now allocate memory as well in the shared spaced (i.e. 
  that can be available to all callbacks). 

. Support for multiple exporters in sniffer-flowtools

  It is now possible to receive and process a NetFlow stream (via flowtools)
  that contains flow records coming from multiple routers. An option 
  in the sniffer-flowtools allows to pick which exporter the modules should
  be looking at ("exporter=a.b.c.d").

. Virtual Nodes

  Added support for virtual nodes that process a portion of the incoming 
  packet stream (e.g., a single VLAN or one interface of a router) with the
  same modules used for the main node. Virtual nodes can be queried 
  independently of the master node.  

. Hash library

  A generic hash table implementation has been added. It has already been
  integrated into the core and its genericity allows for its usage also by
  modules.

. Major rewrite of inline mode

  The new inline mode can be invoked by using the command: 

      "como [options] module-name[:module-args] [filter]"

  This mode of operations forces como to run one single module and 
  output all the module records to standard output as if a query with 
  argument "format=pretty" were run. 

. Changes in the callbacks data structure

  Added a new callback flush() to reinitialize the state after CAPTURE 
  has sent it to EXPORT. This is a first change of a series of long-term
  changes to the module callbacks. 

. Rewrite of wireless support 

  The wireless support has undergone a major rewrite in order to acquire
  support for more chipsets coming with different radio information.
  A tiny layer of software maps between the different radio header to the
  CoMo preferred radio structure. The L2 type COMOTYPE_RADIO is used to
  denote the presence of such structure in captured packets.
  The sniffer-prism2 has been replaced with the more generic sniffer-radio,
  that supports on Linux the PrismII and Atheros chipsets interfaced with
  orinoco, hostap and madwifi drivers. The chipset is automatically put in
  monitor mode by sniffer-radio. Eventually this sniffer is able to support any
  chipset for which the Linux driver implements the monitor mode ioctl.
  The sniffer-pcap can read traces of 802.11 packets with or without radio
  information.

. Major rewrite of query-ondemand

  On demand queries (i.e. those queries that require a module to act as 
  a source of data for another module) now create a new running copy of 
  the CAPTURE/EXPORT pair running in inline mode with a source of data 
  the sniffer-como. This rewrite allows for a much simpler debugging of 
  the on-demand queries as well as to let this system follow the same 
  evolution of the rest of the core processes. 

. New module: dhcp.c
  
  This module parses the BOOTP/DHCP messages and maintains the list of 
  IP addresses allocated to each MAC address. 


-------------------------------------
---- CoMo v0.5 (Dec 16th, 2005)
--

. Implemented WINPCAP sniffer

  Sniffer to support winpcap library. This sniffer is modelled on top of 
  the sniffer-libpcap. NOTE: the file sniffer-wpcap.c comes with a Microsoft
  Research Shared Source License instead of the BSD license used in the rest
  of the CoMo release.

. Porting to MS Windows (w/Cygwin)

  Ported (and tested) to Microsoft Windows under Cygwin environment. CoMo now
  suports live traffic collection on MS systems using the winpcap library. 

. Inline mode

  It is now possible to run an instance of CoMo inline, i.e., it processes
  a trace file or a live stream running one single module that outputs its
  result directly to stdout. In inline mode CoMo provides the exact same 
  features than the standard running mode. The objective is to present a 
  first user interface that is very similar to tools like tcpdump, flow-tools, 
  etc. For example, one can do 'como -I -M trace -s libpcap:eth0' to receive
  an output that is very similar to 'tcpdump -i eth0'.

. Reorganization of include files

  Small reorganization of include files. Modules just need to include 
  "module.h" and the packet headers are now split between linklayer (including
  netflow), ipv4, ipv6 and wlan. 

. Code ported and tested on gcc 2.9.5 to gcc 4.0.1

  The code has been tested to compile correctly on any used version of 
  the gcc compiler from 2.9.5 to 4.0.1. This required some minor changes
  in the module callbacks data structure. 

. Filter syntax

  The syntax of the per-module packet filter has been modified and 
  enriched. It now uses flex and bison to parse the string and supports
  semantically equivalent filters that are syntaxically different. 
  The new filters can have the form: "tcp and not src 10.0.0.1/24". 

. Modified mechanism to load modules

  Modules are now loaded by SUPERVISOR after all other processes (i.e., 
  CAPTURE, EXPORT, STORAGE) have been created. This allows for loading 
  modules on the fly without having to stop any of the processes.  

. New module: topports.c
 
  This module fings the top source/destination ports (in terms of bytes) 
  observed during a measurement interval. It supports html output format. 

. New module: ports.c

  This module counts the number of packets that use a certain 
  port number (source or destination) and returns the aggregate 
  value per measurement interval. It can also produce a scatter
  plot where each dot has coordinates (x,y) where x is the least 
  significant byte of the port number, y is the most significant byte.
  It support gnuplot output format. 

. New module: netflow-anon.c 

  This module processes information from a COMOTYPE_NF stream and prints 
  out a set of fields chosen at query time. The source and destination 
  addresses are anonymized by zero-ing out the least significant bits of 
  the address using the network mask (i.e., a.b.c.d/24 becomes a.b.c.0/24). 

. New module: interarrival.c 

  This module classifies packets into 5-tuple flows and reports on the 
  timestamp of each packet observed during a measurement interval for that 
  flow. This way it is possible to compute the interarrival times of 
  packets within a single flow. 

. New module: list.c 
 
  This modyle reports on the APs observed by the wireless card and outputs
  the AP MAC address, SSID, SNR and other 802.11 specific information. 

. New module: frames.c 

  This module countes the number of 802.11 frames and breaks them down 
  in management, control and data frames. It supports gnuplot format. 

. New module: anomaly-ewma.c 

  This module detects anomalies in the number of bytes or packets observed 
  using an exponential wiegthed moving average to predict the number of 
  bytes or packets the monitor should observe each interval. If the actual 
  number differs by a configurable threshold the module raises an alert. 
  This module supports html output format. 

. New module: active-flows.c

  This module computes the number of active flows in each measurement 
  interval. An active flow is defined as a 5-tuple flow for which the 
  monitor observed at least one packet. This module supports gnuplot output
  format. 

. Completed support for ARM-based platforms 

  Fixed all alignment issues with ARM based platforms replacing all 
  macros that were dealing with packet fields when the packet was not 
  aligned to the double word (32 bit). 

. PCAP sniffer supports big/little endian machines

  sniffer-pcap.c now deals correctly with trace files stored on a big/little
  endian machine and then processed by a little/big endian machine. This 
  is a necessity given any trace collected using a MAC and processed on 
  another system. 

. HTML format in several modules
 
  Several modules support HTML output (via format=html query). The modules
  that now support this are topdest.c, topports.c, tuple.c and anomaly-ewma.c. 
  This support required to change the query-ondemand.c to send the correct 
  header back. 

. IEEE 802.11 support

  Implemented support for 802.11 frames and network cards in monitor mode. 
  The support includes a large number of macros to directly access 802.11
  information in management, control and data frames. It handles variable 
  length headers and presents an interface to the module developer that 
  makes it easy to implement new modules dealing with 802.11 networks. 

. Re-using data from running modules

  Modules can now reuse data processed by other modules that implement
  the replay() callback. This is entirely done in the QUERY process that
  basically emulates the CAPTURE/EXPORT processes. It can be triggered by
  using the source option in the HTTP query as follows

  http://<host>/?module=counter&time=-1m:0&filter=src 10.0.0.1&source=tuple

  This query will read the output of the tuple module in the last minute 
  and use the counter module to count all bytes and packets sent by source 
  IP address 10.0.0.1.

. Configuration file

  CoMo monitors changes to the configuration file and implements them 
  without any need to restart. For now, the only supported changes are 
  the addition or removal of modules. 

. Embronyal Resource Management

  A rather simple mechanism for resource management is now included in 
  the code. It can be turned on setting the DO_RESOURCE_MANAGEMENT flag
  in the configuration file. 

. Resolution for gnuplot files in several modules

  The counter, protocol, application modules accept a new parameter 
  in the query ("granularity") to specify the resolution of the results.
  This can be done to reduce the data transfer when the query covers a 
  large period of time. 

. HTTP queries include "time" flag

  Implemented alternative way to define the time window of a query. It 
  is possible now to define a time window as follows "time=@103000:+50s"
  that means "start at 10.30 current day for 50 seconds" or "time=-30s:+50s" 
  that means "start 30s before query receive time and end 50s after query
  receive time". 

. NetFlow information in the packets 
 
  New packet type (COMOTYPE_NF) that indicates packets preceded by routing
  information (e.g., AS number, prefix length, etc.) as derived by processing
  NetFlow records. This packet type is generated by sniffer-flowtools. 

. Implemented sniffer-prism2

  New sniffer to handle Prism2 chipsets (802.11 cards) in monitor mode. 
  Together with the sniffer a new include file "stdwlan.h" contains several
  macros to process IEEE 802.11 frames. Under Linux it requires Wireless 
  Extensions to be already installed on the system. The code has not been 
  tested with Atheros cards yet. The COMOTYPE_PRISM is now defined to 
  indicate packets preceded by a Prism header (with radio information). 

. TSC timer support
  
  Added support for timing and profiling the source code. A simple API 
  to access the CPU's timestamp counter is provided. 

. Small directory reorg
  
  Directories have been reorganized with a new directory src/sniffers 
  that contains all sniffers currently implemented. The util.c files
  has also been split in several util-*.c files for the different types
  of helper functions. 


--------------------------------
---- CoMo v0.4 (Jun 20th, 2005)
--

. Packet data structure (pkt_t)

  The new pkt_t data structure now contains a pointer to the 
  full packet payload and a set of pointers to reach layer3 and 
  layer4 headers. This allows for variable lenght headers at 
  layer 2 and 3.

. Sniffers

  The code of all sniffers has been simplified thanks to the new
  pkt_t data structure. We have removed the need of a memory copy 
  in the DAG and SK98 sniffers as well as in all sniffers that read 
  a trace from file. 

  We now support multiple instances of any sniffers although CAPTURE
  does not attempt to reorder packets from multiple sniffers if they
  are not time-ordered, i.e. if multiple sniffers are defined packets 
  can have non-monotonically increasing timestamps. 

. Stargate

  Added configuration variable to compile the code for the Stargate
  platform (see platformx.sourceforge.net). It needs arm-linux-gcc 3.2.2. 
  Porting to the Stargate required to link libpcap.so dynamically. 

. Adaptive polling time 

  All sniffers that do not support select() can now change the polling 
  interval to deal with burst of packets or when waiting for new data.

. Support for link layer protocols

  New link layer protocols fully support: VLAN tags, ISL. IEEE 802.11 
  is understood but the support is still very basic. We have defined 
  COMOTYPE_XXX constants to specify the Layer2 protocol, e.g. COMOTYPE_ETH, 
  COMOTYPE_VLAN, etc.

. Sniffer flow-tools 

  This sniffer now allows: i) to scale the number of packets and bytes according
  to the sampling rate; ii) to filter flow records depending on the router 
  output interface; iii) deal with new flowtools file received from the 
  collector. 

. Status information 

  It is possible to define some status information (node name, location, etc)
  in the configuration file. This information is accessed with 
  http://localhost:44444/?status

. Behavior of print() callback 

  The print callback is now called by query-ondemand() once before the records
  are processed and once after all records are processed. This allows 
  the modules to add an header and footer to the output stream.

. Modules

  Counter, Utilization, Application now support gnuplot scripts using the 
  new print() callback behavior. The scripts only work with gnuplot v4 that
  supports receiving data from standard input and require some additional 
  processing. To receive a postscript image out of the counter module one
  can do: 

    fetch -o - "http://localhost:44444/?module=counter&format=gnuplot" |   \
    awk '{v[i++] = $0; print $0;} /^e/ {for (j=1;j<i;j++) print v[j];}' |   \
    gnuplot > tmp.eps
 

--------------------------------
---- CoMo v0.3 (May 30th, 2005)
--

. Sniffers 

  Consistent use of pkt_t in the sniffers implemented so far. 
  Added a new flag (SNIFF_FILE) to indicate that the sniffer is
  operating from a trace file. This allows CAPTURE to slow down (i.e., 
  stop reading packets) when the memory is scarce. 

. Implemented sniffer-flowtools

  CoMo can now read a directory that contains flow-tools files. 
  The sniffer supports only NetFlow v5 and regenerates a packet stream
  that "resembles" the original stream. 

. HTTP-like query interface 

  This allows to query a como machine from any browser with something 
  like: http://<hostname>:44444?module=counter&format=gnuplot&start...
  We also use the HTTP error codes to send error messages or other 
  information. 

. Full packet capture 

  CAPTURE deals with sniffers that provide full packet payloads. 

. Snort module 

  Understand Snort rules' syntax and runs them on the packet stream 
  within CoMo. 

. Implemented sniffer-sk98

  Support Syskonnect cards. It runs only under Linux and requires a 
  dedicated driver that can be found at 
  http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/nprobe/downloads/sk98lin.tar.bz2

. Module data re-use

  A new callback (replay()) is now defined that allows a module to generate
  a packet stream from its own data base.

. Implemented sniffer-como

  A CoMo system can now receive a packet stream from another CoMo system. 
  The sniffer goes through the usual query interface and requests one 
  module to generate a packet stream from its own database. 

. Command line interface

  It is possible to run CoMo from the command link in the absence of a 
  configuration file. 

. Support for Cisco HDLC and Cisco ISL

  CoMo can monitor links using Cisco HDLC and Cisco ISL (ISL is only 
  supported for Endace DAG cards and the information is discarded). 
  
. Improved user interface

  The use interface now prints the amount of shared memory used, the 
  number of packets processed and the active modules. 

. Removed query process. 

  SUPERVISOR is now in charge of receiving queries and to fork a 
  query-ondemand process for each incoming query. 

. Configurable CAPTURE flush intervals

  Each module can now configure the min-flush and max-flush intervals 
  that indicate how often (or how rarely) CAPTURE should flush the module
  state and send it to EXPORT. 

  CAPTURE will choose any value between min-flush and max-flush according 
  to its needs (right now just memory).

. Speeding up STORAGE operations

  Reduced the amount of coordination between storage-client and storage-server
  to speed up disk access. Storage-server is not informed of read operations 
  that do not require a new mmap operation. The minimum size of an mmap is 
  also defined within storage and has no relationship with the block size 
  required by the client process. 
  
. Cleaned up modules' code

  The FLOWDESC now contains only information that the module can modify. 
  The rec_t structure used to link it to the hash tables is not visible 
  anymore. 

. Modified behavior of print() to allow writing header and footer

  The print() callback gets called once before the records and after the
  all records are processed. This allows a module to add a header or a 
  footer to the print out. Useful to embed data in other scripts (e.g., 
  gnuplot, html, etc.).
