The CoMo (Continuous Monitoring) project.

CoMo is a passive monitoring system that supports arbitrary real time
traffic queries or retrospective queries on stored traffic traces.
Data streams may have different formats (e.g., packet/flow sequences,
etc.) and originate from different platforms (e.g, packet sniffers,
routers, wireless APs, ...). CoMo can operate in the presence of different
devices and data sources and provide a unified data interface to queries.
Multiple CoMo systems will also cooperate to rapidly disseminate queries
throughout the network of monitors, allowing operators to "drill down"
to relevant data locations in the network.
