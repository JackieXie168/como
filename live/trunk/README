--------------------------
This is a graphical query interface for CoMo. 

This is just meant to be a template and it requires a significant 
amount of configuration and customization to adapt it to the 
particular environment where it is supposed to run. 

-- Installation notes

 . Create a directory named 'results' and a directory 'db' where 
   apache can write. 
 . Edit the comolive.conf file to set several variables 
   needed to locate the files and the directories results and db. 
 . PHP must be > 4.3.0
 . GNUPLOT must be > 4.0
 . CONVERT must be available 

-- Edit the node database 
 
 . The page gives the ability to add a CoMo node to the list of 
   queryable nodes. However, it will give the option of sorting 
   nodes by continent. This should be programmed according to your
   needs. 

-- Allow/Deny certain queries. 

 . By default, the web page will present four areas. One with the 
   image that comes from a query to a set of modules. The modules will 
   be chosen by querying initially the node to know with modules can be 
   queried. Then an array in mainstage.php selects which ones will not be 
   shown. Then on the side of the page there will be three more queries to 
   the module alert, topdest, topports. If no modules with these names 
   exists it will return an error.
