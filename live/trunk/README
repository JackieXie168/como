. Node database

 The .list files in the $NODEDB directory contain the lists of
 nodes grouped according to continent (in the current
 definition given by list.php).

 Each line in the .list files must contain the following
 information.

 (first line): <name of region>
 (second line): <headings of columns>
 (next lines): <host>; <name>; <location>; <interface>; <data feed>;

 The file list.php looks for files with names like europe.list, 
 north_america.list, etc. Change the names according to your 
 system settings.
