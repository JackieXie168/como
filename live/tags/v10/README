CoMolive! v1.0

--------------------------
This is a graphical query interface for CoMo. 

This is just meant to be a template and it requires a significant 
amount of configuration and customization to adapt it to the 
particular environment where it is supposed to run. 

-- Installation notes

 . Create a directory named 'results' and a directory 'db' where 
   apache can write. 
 . Edit the comolive.conf file to set several variables 
   needed to locate the files and the directories results and db. 
 . PHP must be >= 4.3.0
 . GNUPLOT must be >= 4.0
 . CONVERT must be available (from ImageMagick) 

-- Edit the node database 
 
 . The page gives the ability to add a CoMo node to the list of 
   queryable nodes.

-- Allow/Deny certain queries. 

 . By default, the web page will present four areas corresponding to 
   four queries. The main area with a JPEG image will have a set of tabs 
   corresponding to all modules running on the CoMo node. In order to remove
   a tab update the variable $DONOTSHOW in the comolive.conf file, e.g., to 
   remove the "trace" module from the tab list add
     '$DONOTSHOW = array(0 => "trace");'
